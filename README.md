# Ziptilla
Ziptilla is a modified version of Utilla that works exactly the same, except it removes the restriction of only being able to use "legal mods" in modded lobbies. With Ziptilla, you can use any mod that depends on Utilla in public lobbies, which basically turns every legal mod into a cheat.

## Installation

Go to the [latest release of this mod](https://github.com/VTMGR/Ziptilla/releases/latest) and put the DLL Into your plugins folder!
